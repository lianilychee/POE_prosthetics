POE Project by Celine Ta, Liani Lye, Ellie Funkhouser and Victoria Preston in Fall 2014

The goal of the project is to create an intuitive feedback and control prosthetic arm.  This is an 8-week project for Principles of Engineering at Olin Colelge of Engineering.

This repo is a collection of deliverables and prototypes.  Most programming will be done on the Arduino IDE platform.  

The microcontroller for the project is an Arduino Uno.  We may shift to another microcontroller partway through the project.
